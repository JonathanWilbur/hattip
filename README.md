## What is it?

Hat-Tip is a simple REST API testing web app, powered by
[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). An example can be seen
[here](http://hattip.wilbur.space).

Features:

* Configurable Endpoints
* Request History
* Response colors vary based on the status code

## How do I use it?

Everything is client-side, and no building, transpiling, or compiling is
necessary: just share the contents of the `client` folder from an HTTP server
and you're good to go!

## Legal Note

This library comes bundled with the `Vollkorn` font, which can be found in
`client/fonts`. This font is released under a different license than this
web application. Be mindful of the legal ramifications of your use of this
web application and the included font.
